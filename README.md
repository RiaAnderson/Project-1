# Utopia Intergalactic Travel
Website for an intergalactic travel agency.
 
## Description
Our website was created to showcase intergalactic travel. This code provides various pages to display travel packages, destination information, pictures, safety tips, and a contact form. Utopia Intergalactic Travel use two NASA API's to provide vital information to the user. The first API allows the user to track asteroids near earth and the potential threat of each asteroid. The other API displays NASA photographs with descriptions that tell the user about the photograph. Parsley was added to the contact form to ensure the user enters in all required information. This code can be changed to fit the needs of an Earth based travel agency.
